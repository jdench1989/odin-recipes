    <h3>This comfort food classic is just as flavorful and soul-satisfying as Grandma's chicken soup, but where hers took several hours-or a day-to make, ours takes under an hour. </h3>
    <p>Instead of long-simmered stock, we start with store-bought chicken broth and water but enrich them with stock vegetables and the carcass, bones and meat of a leftover roast chicken.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Carcass and bones from one 4- to 5-pound roast chicken (or a mild-flavored rotisserie chicken)</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick slices</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
