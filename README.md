This project will use my current understanding of HTML to create a simple Recipes website.

It will also allow me to practice good version control using git and GitHub.

Reflection after HTML stage:
I found the project relatively easy and encountered no issues with syntax etc. 
I need to ensure I am commiting more often as I came to realise that at times I'd complete several steps of the build before commiting. I tried to ensure that I was commiting more often, after any significant change to the code or addition etc.
